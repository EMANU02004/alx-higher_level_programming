0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures
JavaScript<br>

JAVASCRIPT OBJECT BASICS<br>
~An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).

Closures<br>
~A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
